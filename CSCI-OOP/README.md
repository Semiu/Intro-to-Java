# Object Oriented Software Construction Using Java

There are thirteen folders in this repo, with their respective and different contents. Comments are provided in the source
code to provide enough guide.

## Accounting

This contains a demonstration of how deep clone of object works. It is used for an account object that contains fundamental 
methods and instance variables, such as depositAmmount, withdrawAmount, checkBalance. It enforces applicable logical rules 
such as amountDeposit or amountWithdraw cannot be negative.

## AgileDesignPrinciple

This contains a demonstration of inheritance using Rectangle and Square objects as example.

## AgilePrincipleNoPrivate

This contains a demonstration of inheritance between Rectangle and Square objects, whereby the instance variables are set 
to be private.

## Chapter 11

This contains an instructor's demonstration of readFile methods, and readNext when the datatype in the stream violates the contract
principle.

## ExceptionHandling2

This contains a demonstration of how to handle exception through organised panic and retrying. 

## ExceptionHandling

This contains a demonstration of how to handle exception through organised panic and retrying. 

## Performance Testing

This is a demonstration of how sentinel values can be used testing performance of different methods using different loops.

## PolymorphismExample

This demonstrates how polymorphism can be used to solve the limitation of inheritance, especially the Interface Seperation technique.

## RefactorPolymorphic

This demonstrates how refactoring using inheritance -not polymorphism- can be used in dealing with switch-case statement.

## RefactorPolymorphicUpdate

This demosntrates the quality of refactoring done, as in RefactorPolymorphic, if by updating the class objects, it does not violate
the Open Closed Principle.

## RefactorSwitchDay

This demonstrates using switch case statemement whereby two different switch conditions are considered.

## Refactoring

This demonstrates how refactoring can be performed -it simply illusrates how code quality can be improved without changing the
observable behavior of the method.

## RefactoringSwitch

This demonstrates using switch case statemement for a single switch condition.
